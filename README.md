## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* A [Claude Sonnet API](https://www.anthropic.com/docs/) key
* `pip` installed

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshikathota/TripPlanner.git
   cd TripPlanner
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Claude API key:

   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= your_anthropic_api_key
   ```

## Usage

Run the CLI to start planning:

```bash
python trip_planner.py
```

1. Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter preferences (e.g., destination, dates, interests, budget).
2. The Assistant will use CrewAI agents and Claude API to query and build an itinerary.
3. Once finalized, the itinerary is written to a `.txt` file (e.g., `trip_plan.txt`) in the working directory.
